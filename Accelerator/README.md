# Accelerator

> compile [this](./HLS/) folder in Vitis and then build the bitstream in Vivado, and then add the `.bit`/`.hwh` files to the Z2 (renamed as `accel.bit` and `accel.hwh`)

> add [this](./Networking/FPGA/main.py) on the Z2, and then run it

> run [this](./Networking/HOST/main.py) on your host machine

> > note: this simulates a single accelerated timestep using the test harness [here](../IR/test.harness)
